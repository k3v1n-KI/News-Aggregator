       "  'content': 'European astronomers released the first images from the new Euclid space telescope last week.\\n\\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) and the U.S. space agency, NASA, designed Euclid to study dark matter and dark energy. Scientists think those hidden forms of matter and energy make up 95 percent of the universe.\\n\\nESA is leading the six-year mission with NASA as a partner. ESA said the images were the most detailed of their kind. They show the telescope\\'s ability to observe billions of galaxies up to 10 billion light years away.\\n\\nThe images covered four areas of the sky. They include 1,000 galaxies belonging to the Perseus cluster of galaxies 240 million light years away. In the background, the image shows more than 100,000 galaxies, ESA said.\\n\\nThe cluster is called the Perseus cluster because it appears in the star group, or constellation, Perseus.\\n\\nScientists believe such large structures like the Perseus cluster could only have formed if dark matter exists.\\n\\nESA\\'s science director Carole Mundell said, \"We think we understand only 5 percent of the universe: that\\'s the matter that we can see.”\\n\\n\"The rest of the universe we call dark,” she continued, “because it doesn\\'t produce light...But we know its effect because we see the effect on visible matter.\"\\n\\nOne sign of dark matter’s hidden force is that galaxies rotate more quickly than scientists expect.\\n\\nMundell said it seems to have the effect of pulling together some of the largest structures in the universe, like groups of galaxies.\\n\\nDark energy is a new mystery\\n\\nIn the 1990s, scientists largely established the existence of dark matter after studying exploding stars called supernovas. That work resulted in a 2011 Nobel Prize shared between three U.S.-born scientists.\\n\\nLooking at images from the earlier Hubble Space Telescope, scientists came to believe that the universe was not only expanding but that it was expanding faster and faster. That surprising discovery relied on a new concept: dark energy.\\n\\nA new galaxy map\\n\\nEuclid has been in a period of testing since its launch. Now it will start taking the images to make a 3D, or three-dimensional, map covering about a third of the sky. Scientists will use that map to look for small differences caused by the dark universe. Scientists hope the new understanding of dark energy and matter will help us learn about how galaxies formed, and why they are found across the universe.\\n\\nMundell said, \"The purpose of the Euclid mission is really to start to probe that dark sector of the universe in ways that we\\'ve been unable to presently with current ground and space missions.\"\\n\\nShe added that the Perseus cluster is a good example of this huge gathering of mass. “We think there\\'s lots of dark matter in that cluster and pulling these galaxies together.\"\\n\\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched Euclid from Florida in July.\\n\\nThe mission is expected to last six years. However, ESA hopes that Euclid will continue another six months if there is enough fuel to keep it in orbit around the sun. Euclid is orbiting the sun about 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth at \"Lagrange Point Two,\" or L2. That is a place where the gravity of the sun, moon and Earth are balanced. A spacecraft can stay there, using less fuel. NASA\\'s James Webb Space Telescope is also at L2, but it is not in danger of crashing into Euclid.\\n\\nOther images released by ESA included an unusual galaxy with no exact form. Another was a spiral galaxy, sometimes called the \"Hidden Galaxy,\" which looks much like our home galaxy, the Milky Way.\\n\\nSpeaking of the Perseus cluster, Mundell said, \"You\\'ll also see lots of background galaxies there as well, which is phenomenal. I think I spotted a new one there last night.\"\\n\\nI’m Jill Robbins.\\n\\nThis story was reported by Tim Hepher and Steve Gorman for Reuters.

He was 54.\\n\\nDespite initial toxicology reports coming up negative for fentanyl or meth, Edwards says “things aren’t adding up” when it comes to the details of his death.\\n\\n5 Matthew Perry’s ex-girlfriend claims the actor’s death “doesn’t add up.” TheImageDirect.com\\n\\n“They said there were no prescription painkillers at the scene, which doesn’t surprise me, because he didn’t leave drugs lying around,” Edwards said.\\n\\nAs previously reported, no illicit drugs were found on the premises of Perry’s Pacific Palisades digs aside from a few prescription medications.\\n\\n“He was paranoid and would take them all, so there wasn’t any evidence, and then go out for more when he was ready to.”\\n\\n5 Perry shared a snap of himself in the hot tub a few days before his passing. Matthew Perry\\n\\nEdwards told the outlet that Perry’s final Instagram post had clues that point toward a possible relapse.\\n\\nThe comedian’s last Instagram post, taken five days before his passing, was a snap of him in the jacuzzi with the caption, “Oh, so warm water swirling around makes you feel good? I’m Mattman.”\\n\\nFor more Page Six you love …\\n\\nAccording to Edwards, Perry’s use of “Mattman” was allegedly a tell that the “Whole Nine Yards” star was using illicit drugs again.\\n\\n“That Mattman thing was not something he did when he was sober. Mattman would come out when he was not sober and he felt kind of invincible,” Edwards claimed.\\n\\n5 Perry’s ex, Kayti Edwards, speculates that he might have “taken pills in the week leading up” to his death. Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images\\n\\n“I was around when he was getting high, although I was not getting high with him, and when I would say maybe he should cool it a little bit with the drugs, he would say, ‘No, I’m Mattman.'”\\n\\nEdwards further claimed that Perry had an affinity for being in the water when he would drink alcohol or use drugs, alleging that a former neighbor once found him “naked and high in his [neighbor’s] swimming pool.”\\n\\nRead more about Matthew Perry’s life and struggles:\\n\\n“I had to go over there and get him out of his neighbor’s pool. He had a thing with water when he was doing drugs,” she claimed, adding that Perry was allegedly “always alone” when he did drugs.\\n\\n5 Edwards and the “Friends” star allegedly dated in 2006. Getty Images\\n\\nA rep for Perry did not immediately respond to Page Six’s request for comment.\\n\\nEdwards previously claimed to be a delivery driver for Perry at the height of his addiction in 2011, telling the Sun in a 2020 interview that she would pick up “cocaine, heroin and crack” for the actor while she was five months pregnant.\\n\\n“I was like five months pregnant going down and getting stuff for him. He [would say], ‘No one’s going to pull over a pregnant girl. Don’t worry,’” she recalled.\\n\\n5 Perry’s funeral was held last week in Los Angeles. Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images\\n\\nIn Perry’s memoir, “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,” the actor detailed his tumultuous, decades-long history with drug and alcohol addiction.\\n\\nThe ’90s sitcom star got candid about the good, bad and ugly of his life in the throes of addiction.\\n\\n“Not only do I have the disease, but I also have it bad. I have it as bad as you can have it, in fact. It’s back-to-the-wall time all the time. It’s going to kill me …”\\n\\nPerry was laid to rest at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills on Nov. 8.\",\n",

While Storm appeared to concede at first, when the crew member walked away, she said she\\'d continue to \"sing it on the low\" and then proceeded to do so.\\n\\nOn Sunday, a Delta representative told Insider the company had been in touch with Storm but declined to comment further other than to say, \"For the safety of our customers and crew, it\\'s always important to follow crew instructions.\"\\n\\nIn a follow-up video posted Saturday, Storm said Delta had reached out but added she didn\\'t want the employee to be \"reprimanded.\"\\n\\n\"I simply want us to keep in mind how to treat each other,\" she said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDozens of comments on Storm\\'s posts called the singer out, accusing her of being \"out of order.\" Several commented that the employee was just \"doing his job\" and that some passengers may not want to listen to somebody singing on a flight.\\n\\nThis has been a year of unruly passengers, with numerous people being kicked off flights for inappropriate behavior.\\n\\nIn June, a Delta flight had to make an unscheduled landing after a passenger became \"unruly\" and had to be restrained by other travelers. A United flight had to be diverted the following month after an economy passenger walked up to the business-class section.',\n",

       "  'content': 'For many years, scientists have studied rocks from Mars that have crash-landed on Earth, providing valuable insights into the Red Planet’s geology. However, an intriguing puzzle has emerged – these Martian rocks appear to be much younger than expected. While Mars itself is estimated to have formed around 4.56 billion years ago, the ages of these rocks don’t align with the planet’s overall age.\\n\\nThe explanation, according to a group of scientists who published a paper in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters, lies in the ongoing bombardment of Mars’ surfacemeteorites and asteroids. The Red Planet experiences around 200 meteorite impacts each year, resulting in the creation of 4-meter craters. These impacts send rock fragments hurtling into space, some of which eventually reach Earth.\\n\\nThe continuous replenishment of Martian rocks from beneath the planet’s surface, fueledvolcanic activity, is the key to unraveling this mystery. As the younger rocks replace the older ones that are ejected into space, the rocks found on Earth appear much younger than the Martian surface as a whole.\\n\\nThis discovery has significant implications for our understanding of Mars’ geological processes. It sheds light on how the planet is constantly changing, both internally and externally, which has important implications for future manned missions to Mars. Furthermore, studying these rocks provides valuable insights into the formation of planets within our solar system and the broader evolution of the universe.\\n\\nFAQ:\\n\\nQ: Why do Martian rocks found on Earth appear younger than the planet itself?\\n\\nA: The continuous bombardment of Mars’ surfacemeteorites and asteroids results in the ejection of younger rocks, replacing the older ones that are collected on Earth.\\n\\nQ: How many meteorite impacts does Mars experience annually?\\n\\nA: Mars experiences approximately 200 meteorite impacts each year.\\n\\nQ: What is the significance of studying Martian rocks?\\n\\nA: Understanding Mars’ geological processes helps in preparation for future manned missions to the planet and provides insights into the formation of planets and the evolution of the universe as a whole.\\n\\nQ: What is the approximate age of Mars?\\n\\nA: Mars is estimated to have formed around 4.56 billion years ago.',\n",

       "  'content': 'The view at Snowdrift Peak NASA\\n\\nIn about a third of the time it would have taken other NASA Mars rovers, Perseverance recently navigated its way through a field of boulders more than 1,700 feet wide (about a half-kilometer). While planners map out the rover’s general routes, Perseverance managed the finer points of navigating the field, nicknamed “Snowdrift Peak,” on its own, courtesy of AutoNav, the self-driving system that helps cut down driving time between areas of scientific interest.\\n\\nIn fact, Perseverance has set rover speed records on Mars since landing in February 2021. The feats of AutoNav were detailed in a paper about the rover’s autonomous systems published in the July issue of the journal Science Robotics.\\n\\nTyler Del Sesto has worked on the software for Perseverance’s AutoNav for seven years. He used to think that sometimes the obstacles placed before Perseverance’s Earthly twin OPTIMISM during testing in the Mars Yard at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory went a little overboard. He changed his mind after Snowdrift Peak.\\n\\n“It was much denser than anything Perseverance has encountered before – just absolutely littered with these big rocks,” said Del Sesto, deputy rover planner lead for Perseverance at JPL in Southern California. “We didn’t want to go around it because it would have taken us weeks. More time driving means less time for science, so we just dove right in.”\\n\\nOn June 26, Perseverance entered the eastern edge of Snowdrift Peak. Including two stops for boulders that the science team wanted to inspect, the straight-line route through Snowdrift would cover 1,706 feet (520 meters). By the time the rover exited the western edge of the boulder field on July 31, it had logged 2,490 feet (759 meters) – with much of the extra distance coming from AutoNav maneuvering around rocks not visible in the orbiter images used to plan the route.\\n\\n“If you take out the sols (Martian days) dedicated to mission science, the traverse through Snowdrift Peak only took six autonomous drive sols, which is probably 12 sols faster than Curiosity would have taken,” said Del Sesto. “Of course, everybody on the team knows we only got to this level of performance by standing on the shoulders of giants. Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity were the trailblazers.”\\n\\nOn the Wheels of Giants\\n\\nSome form of silicon-based navigator has been in use since the first Mars rover started dodging rocks in 1997. Back then, the microwave oven-size Sojourner needed to stop every 5.1 inches (13 centimeters) for its computer brain to take stock of its new environs before proceeding farther. The next Mars rovers – the golf cart-size Spirit and Opportunity (which arrived in 2004) – could drive distances up to 1.6 feet (0.5 meters) before they too had to halt and figure out next moves.\\n\\nCuriosity, which landed in 2012, recently got a software upgrade to help make driving decisions, but Perseverance packs several advantages: With faster cameras, the rover can take images quickly enough to process its route in real-time, and it has an additional computer dedicated entirely to image processing, eliminating the need to pause to decide its next move.\\n\\n“Our rover is the perfect example of the old adage ‘two brains are better than one,’” said Vandi Verma, lead author of the paper and the mission’s chief engineer for robotic operations at JPL. “Perseverance is the first rover that has two computer brains working together, allowing it to make decisions on the fly.”\\n\\nThis autonomous capability has allowed Perseverance to set new records for Mars off-roading, including a single-day drive distance of 1140.7 feet (347.7 meters) and longest drive without human review: 2296.2 feet (699.9 meters). But those achievements took place back when the rover was driving across the relatively flat terrain of Jezero Crater’s floor, without large rocks and other craters standing in its way. That’s why this recent navigation of boulder-festooned Snowdrift Peak impressed even the engineers who plan rover outings.\\n\\nNew Campaign New Terrain\\n\\nWhile the boulder field may be in Perseverance’s metaphorical rearview mirror, more driving challenges lay ahead. The rover began its fourth science campaign on Sept. 7 by crossing “Mandu Wall,” a rolling ridgeline separating two geologic units along the inner edge of Jezero Crater’s western rim. Orbital data indicates the area is filled with carbonates – which may provide invaluable data on Mars’ environmental history as well as preserve signs of ancient microbial life, if any existed in the area.\\n\\n“The time where a rover science team could look at features on the Martian horizon and file them away for future consideration is over,” said Ken Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech in Pasadena. “We have to be on our toes because Perseverance’s autonomous capabilities can make something we see in the distance on one sol right in front – or even behind us – on the next.”\\n\\nWith the new exploration possibilities come new challenges: broken bedrock, higher slopes, and sand dunes, as well as small impact craters in Perseverance’s near future.\\n\\n“This new terrain is definitely going to throw a few curveballs at us and AutoNav,” said Mark Maimone, deputy team chief for robotic operations on Perseverance. “But that is where the science is. We’re ready.”\\n\\nMore About the Mission\\n\\nA key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet’s geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust).\\n\\nSubsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.\\n\\nThe Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.\\n\\nJPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover.\\n\\nFor more about Perseverance: mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\\n\\nAutonomous robotics is driving Perseverance rover’s progress on Mars, Science Robotics\\n\\nAstrobiology',\n",

What I certainly do not think of is a first-gen (NA) Mazda Miata. That's why this 1990 Miata drag racer for sale on Facebook Marketplace is so delightfully incongruous that I can't help but want it.\\n\\nSeeing something as small as a Miata with a massive dragster scoop on its hood, a wheelie bar, and Hoosier drag radials is objectively funny, like seeing Danny Devito in Football pads. It gets even better when you see the massive Kaiser racing engine under its hood. The car is currently being sold as a roller, without the engine or transmission, for $22,000 but the seller will consider selling it as a complete running car for $39,000.\\n\\nThe engine itself is also for sale separately. It's a 322-cubic-inch (5.2-liter) Kaiser racing engine, based on a Chevy V8 with an Aurora short-deck block, Bryant crankshaft, and Jesel Keyed lifters, among many other goodies. It makes 855 horsepower, which is hilarious in something as small and light as a stripped-out Miata.\\n\\nEven without the powertrain, though, this Miata dragster still comes with a Chromoly 8.50 certified roll cage, a custom-fabricated Chromoly four-link rear end with Strange Engineering double-adjustable coilovers, a 40-spline aluminum differential, carbon fiber driveshaft, Hoosier slicks wrapped around beadlock wheels, a wheelie bar, and a new parachute.\\n\\nThe build quality looks great, too. Without getting your paws on it in person, there's no way of telling truly how well made it is but it passes the eye test. If you're looking for a pint-sized drag racer, this little Miata seems like an absolute blast. Plus, you can buy it with its powertrain or without, so you can choose your engine.\\n\\nI've never seen a Miata drag racer before today but now that's the only kind I want to see.\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority\\n\\nGoogle One storage is the default cloud storage service on Android phones globally, and it makes for a pretty seamless backup experience. The service also means quick-fire access to all your data across loads of devices — convenience at its finest.\\n\\nThere’s one complaint I have about Google One, though. And that’s the fact that Google hasn’t upgraded the base storage in years.\\n\\n100GB was fine a decade ago\\n\\nGoogle Drive was initially released back in 2012, duking it out with iCloud, Dropbox, SkyDrive, and several other storage services. The company’s cheapest paid storage plan gave you 25GB of storage for $2.49 a month. Meanwhile, 100GB of storage would set you back $4.99 a month at launch.\\n\\nGoogle rejigged its pricing in 2014, offering 100GB of base storage for just $1.99 a month. To Google’s credit, this was a solid deal at the time. By contrast, Dropbox’s 100GB plan was priced at $9.99 a month. Apple’s iCloud didn’t have a 100GB plan but charged a pretty respectable $2.99 a month for its 200GB tier. Google would go on to offer a 200GB tier for the same price in 2018.\\n\\nFast-forward to 2023, and the cheapest Google One storage plan is still $1.99 a month for 100GB. We’re clearly way overdue for an upgrade.\\n\\n100GB doesn’t go far in 2023\\n\\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\\n\\nSimply put, 100GB isn’t a lot of storage at all today. Perhaps the biggest reason for this is that Google Photos storage is no longer free.\\n\\nGoogle used to offer unlimited high-quality photo and video backups, and loads of people took advantage of this. These backups didn’t count against your Google cloud storage plan, allowing you to use your free allowing or paid storage plan for other files like documents, RAW files, games, and more.\\n\\nGoogle ditched unlimited free photo/video backups in 2021, but plenty of people still have automatic backups enabled. I’m one of them, which has resulted in my cloud storage being consumed at an exponential rate.\\n\\n100GB of Google One storage doesn't go far when photos and videos count towards your cloud storage plan.\\n\\nThis isn’t helped by the fact that photos and video files are bigger than ever, thanks to features like 8K video, HDR video, and super-high-resolution snaps. We have seen new formats like HEIF photos and HEVC videos, allowing phone makers to offer smaller file sizes or higher quality media at the same file size. However, the overall trend is still towards larger file sizes, especially with phones like the Galaxy S23 Ultra capable of churning out 200MP photos with a file size in excess of 30MB.\\n\\nThe Pixel 8‘s 50MP JPEG pictures account for roughly three times more storage than a 12.5MP image (albeit 9MB versus ~3MB). This trend is also apparent for the iPhone 15 series as the new phones shoot at 24MP by default, reportedly resulting in an admittedly modest ~1MB file increase. But these file sizes still add up over time. Likewise, the Pixel 8 Pro’s Video Boost/Night Sight Video feature requires cloud storage and processing rather than on-device processing, eating up yet more space.\\n\\nSmartphones now offer more local storage and larger photo/video sizes, but cloud storage hasn't kept up.\\n\\nYou could argue that cloud storage is less important as physical storage pools have grown. It’s common to find flagship smartphones with 1TB of storage, while even cheap phones are available with 256GB of storage in 2023. It’s a far cry from the first year of Google Drive when high-end phones offered 16GB to 64GB of storage. Still, there’s no denying that cloud storage is more important than ever for storing files across multiple devices and sharing memories with family and friends. Google’s affordable option simply isn’t keeping pace.\\n\\nStorage tends to get cheaper over time, so I find it hard to believe that cloud storage costs haven’t decreased overall compared to the early 2010s. Either 100GB should be cheaper, or we should have more of it for the same price. However, Google Cloud admittedly announced some hefty price increases in 2022, so perhaps administering this storage is keeping prices up.\\n\\nIt must be said that Google isn’t the only cloud player to hold relatively steady on base storage plans. Apple’s iCloud still retains the same 50GB ($0.99 a month) and 200GB ($2.99 a month) tiers after all this time. Microsoft OneDrive still matches Google by charging $1.99 a month for 100GB of storage, jumping straight to 1TB for a $6.99 monthly fee.\\n\\nTime for Google to change with the times Even if cloud storage costs haven’t fallen significantly in the past decade to enable more base Google One storage, there are still other ways Google could provide more bang for your buck. For one, Google could offer a proper Apple One rival, bundling its various services (including a larger cloud storage plan) into one cost-effective package.\\n\\nIs 100GB of Google One storage enough for you? 5414 votes Yes, it is 13 % No, but I'm fine with buying more storage 12 % No, Google should offer more base storage 74 %\\n\\nThe company could also offer more useful family-sharing functionality (even at a slight premium). This way, each member gets 100GB of storage rather than each family member grabbing a slice of your 100GB storage plan. Google could even theoretically convert our backed-up photos and videos to more efficient HEIF and HEVC formats, freeing up space in the process.\\n\\nEither way, it’s been roughly a decade since Google offered 100GB of base cloud storage for $1.99 a month. Our cloud storage requirements have only skyrocketed since then, so it’s high time the company updated the base Google One storage to reflect this new reality.\\n\\nComments\",\n",

       "  'content': 'Exploring the vast expanse of space beyond Earth’s boundaries has captivated our imaginations for generations. With the ambitious plans of private companies to build hotels in space and NASA’s goal of establishing lunar neighborhoods, humanity is inching closer to realizing these dreams. However, while these space habitats may appear cozy in renderings, it’s crucial to understand the unique challenges that await human explorers in the unforgiving environment of space.\\n\\nOne of the significant hurdles of space travel is the harsh reality of what happens to our bodies without proper protection. In the absence of a spacesuit, humans exposed to low Earth orbit, Mars, or the moon would experience a lack of oxygen, causing them to lose consciousness within seconds and ultimately leading to death. Additionally, the absence of external pressure would cause the gases inside the body to expand, leading to the bubbling of internal fluids.\\n\\nWhile hypoxia poses a significant threat, there are two other challenges that are yet to be fully resolved: variable gravity and radiation. Earth’s gravity, which keeps us grounded, is an omnipresent force that profoundly influences our lives. However, on the moon and Mars, where the gravitational pull is much weaker, life would be dramatically different. The lunar and Martian gravities are only a sixth and a third, respectively, of what we experience on Earth.\\n\\nRadiation exposure is another critical concern for space travelers. As humans venture beyond Earth’s protective ozone and magnetosphere, they are exposed to higher levels of radiation due to the absence of significant atmospheric shielding. The radiation on Mars, for example, potentially surpasses what we encounter on Earth700 times. Furthermore, space travelers encounter high-energy atomic nuclei from exploding stars, which pose additional risks to their health.\\n\\nSo far, information about these challenges primarily comes from astronauts in low Earth orbit, as a limited number of individuals have traveled beyond it. Unfortunately, this sample size is not representative of the overall population, hindering the development of space-based medical science. However, the emerging field of space tourism offers an opportunity to study the effects of radiation and low gravity on a wider demographic.\\n\\nBy gathering data from diverse groups of individuals, including those with pre-existing health conditions and different ages, researchers hope to gain a better understanding of how our bodies adapt to the hostile environment of space. This knowledge will be crucial for ensuring the survival and well-being of future astronauts traveling to Mars or establishing colonies on the moon.\\n\\nIn conclusion, although space travel presents numerous challenges, ongoing research and advancements in space medicine will pave the way for humans to venture beyond Earth with confidence. By addressing the effects of variable gravity and radiation exposure, we can ensure the safety of explorers and unlock the potential of extraterrestrial colonization.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\n\\n1. What would happen to a person in space without a spacesuit?\\n\\nWithout a spacesuit, a person would experience a lack of oxygen and lose consciousness within seconds, ultimately leading to death. The absence of external pressure would cause the gases inside the body to expand, resulting in the bubbling of internal fluids.\\n\\n2. How does variable gravity affect human life in space?\\n\\nOn celestial bodies like the moon and Mars, which have weaker gravitational pulls compared to Earth, life would be significantly different. The lunar and Martian gravities are only a sixth and a third, respectively, of what we experience on Earth, leading to unique physiological changes and challenges for human explorers.\\n\\n3. What are the risks associated with radiation in space?\\n\\nBeyond Earth’s protective ozone and magnetosphere, space travelers are exposed to higher levels of radiation. The radiation on Mars, for example, can potentially be 700 times greater than what we encounter on Earth. The exposure to high-energy atomic nuclei from exploding stars poses additional risks to astronauts’ health.\\n\\n4. How can space tourism contribute to our understanding of space-related health effects?\\n\\nSpace tourism offers an opportunity to study the effects of radiation and low gravity on a wider demographic. By gathering data from diverse groups of individuals, including those with pre-existing health conditions and different ages, researchers can enhance our understanding of how the human body adapts to the hostile environment of space.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Science news this week includes a virus that attached itself to another virus and the first images from ESA\\'s dark universe detective Euclid.\\n\\nThis week in science news, we discovered a virus that attached itself to another virus, saw the Euclid space telescope\\'s magnificent first photos and learned of more orca attacks on boats.\\n\\nIt\\'s the season for viruses going around, but apparently viruses themselves also have to worry about catching something. In a world first, scientists have observed one virus latching onto another . The unusual interaction was captured in astonishing detail using a microscope that fires beams of electrons at its samples.\\n\\nWe\\'re used to the James Webb Space Telescope regularly sending us astonishing images from space ( and this week is no exception ), but now there is a new kid in town with a fancy camera — the European Space Agency\\'s (ESA) Euclid telescope. Its first picture, which captured the Horsehead Nebula , is an absolute peach. But James Webb wasn\\'t slacking off; it also showed us an \" extreme\" glow coming from 90% of the universe\\'s earliest galaxies. Closer to home, a volcanic \"devil comet\" racing toward Earth has resprouted its horns after erupting again.\\n\\nThat comet is not the only thing that has been erupting, as a volcano off the coast of Japan\\'s Iwo Jima island has broken through the surface of the ocean , creating a new, mini island.\\n\\nIf you\\'re as fascinated by facial reconstructions as we are, check out the weathered old face of this Neanderthal man (and read our feature on how researchers can make them so accurate ). But that\\'s not the only \"head\"-related news from the world of archaeology this week, as we learned of the headless skeletons from the largest known headhunting massacre from Neolithic Asia and the first arrival of head lice in North America.\\n\\nFrom the animal kingdom, scientists finally discovered whether a starfish is a head without a body or a body without a head — turns out it\\'s complicated . Other great animal stories include a shark pup\\'s virgin birth in a Chicago aquarium , the deadly end of a rogue bear and chimps using military tactics only seen in humans before .\\n\\nAnd finally, it\\'s not just chimps that have been studying the art of war, as orcas have once again assaulted — and sunk — a boat in Europe, in a relentless, near hour-long attack .\\n\\nFollow Live Science on social media\\n\\nWant more science news?

(Image credit: NYU Langone Health)\\n\\nThis series of images shows the remarkable transformation of Aaron James, a 46-year-old from Arkansas, following a groundbreaking face and eye transplant . James sustained a 7,200-volt electric shock on June 10, 2021, while working as a high-voltage lineman, leaving him with traumatic wounds that required several reconstructive surgeries and ultimately caused him to lose his left eye, nose, lips, front teeth, left cheek and chin, as well as his left arm above the elbow.\\n\\nBut in a groundbreaking procedure, which involved 140 medical providers at NYU Langone and took over 21 hours to complete, James has now received a new face and transplanted eye. \"The eye is an extension of the brain,\" Dr. Vaidehi Dedania , a retina specialist in NYU Langone\\'s Department of Ophthalmology, said at a news conference. \"His retina is able to tell us that it\\'s \\'seeing\\' the light, which is quite remarkable.\"\\n\\nSunday reading\\n\\nLive Science long read\\n\\nYou can\\'t calculate the risk of an asteroid you can\\'t see. (Image credit: Nicholas Forder)\\n\\nOn the morning of Feb. 15, 2013, a meteor the size of a semitrailer shot out from the direction of the rising sun and exploded in a fireball over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia. Briefly glowing brighter than the sun itself, the meteor exploded 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) above the ground with 30 times more energy than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.\\n\\nThe Chelyabinsk meteor is thought to be the biggest natural space object to enter Earth\\'s atmosphere in more than 100 years. Yet no observatory on Earth saw it coming. Arriving from the direction of the sun, the rock remained hidden in our biggest blind spot until it was too late.\\n\\nEvents like these are, fortunately, uncommon. To date, astronomers have mapped the orbits of more than 33,000 near-Earth asteroids and found that none pose a risk of hitting our planet for at least the next century.',\n",

       "  'content': \"Somewhere hurtling more than 200 miles above the planet's surface is one of Earth's newest satellites: a tool bag, and it's possible you might be able to spot it with a telescope or good pair of binoculars if you know where to look.\\n\\nThe white, satchel-like tool bag slipped away from two astronauts during a rare, all-female spacewalk Nov. 1 as they performed maintenance on the International Space Station, according to social media posts on X, formerly Twitter, from scientists and other experts familiar with the situation.\\n\\nWhile there's no official word whether the tool bag contained a 10 mm socket wrench, the bag was spotted floating over Mount Fuji last week by Japanese astronaut Satoshi Furukawa. Now space junk, it has since been cataloged with the ID 58229 / 1998-067WC.\\n\\nIt's not the first tool bag lost in space. In November 2008, Endeavor astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper lost a grip on her backpack-size tool kit while cleaning up a mess from a leaking grease gun, according to space.com.\\n\\nThat tool bag, valued at $100,000, circled the planet for months until meeting its fiery end after plunging to Earth and disintegrating. Experts believe last week's missing tool bag will share the same fate as it hurtles in the upper atmosphere, which has become increasingly littered.\\n\\nAs of September, the European Space Agency estimates 11,000 tons of space objects are orbiting Earth. That includes up to 36,500 pieces of debris greater than 4 inches, objects that could cause cataclysmic damage if they were to hit a satellite or a rocket.\\n\\nHow to see the missing tool bag ISS astronauts dropped using binoculars\\n\\nSpotting a suitcase-size tool bag traveling thousands of miles an hour in the planet's thermosphere isn't the impossible task it might sound like, say avid sky watchers.\\n\\nTo begin, the bag is reflective thanks to catching the sun's rays, and it shines just below the limit of visibility to the unaided eye, according to EarthSky.org, meaning you should be able to spot the tool bag with a good pair of binoculars.\\n\\nUnder clear, dark skies, the bag can be seen floating ahead of the International Space Station, which is the third-brightest object in the night sky and looks like a fast-moving plane, according to NASA.\\n\\nIt's easy to spot if you know where to look.\\n\\nYou can keep track of the ISS online at SpotTheStation.nasa.gov or by downloading the same app on Apple or Google Play.\\n\\nAccording to EarthSky, follow the trajectory of the ISS and scan the sky in the area just ahead of the space station. As the tool bag gradually loses height, it should appear between two and four minutes ahead of the ISS during the next few days.\\n\\nJohn Tufts is a reporter for the Indianapolis Star, part of the USA TODAY Network.

       "  'content': 'For thousands of years, Martian rocks have bombarded Earth, sent flying through space after being ejected from their homeworld by violent impacts or volcanic processes. But as we collect these tiny samples, scientists have started to learn something interesting: the age of these Martian rocks doesn’t line up with what we know about Mars’ age as a whole. They’re a lot younger.\\n\\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\\n\\nMars is really old. Scientists believe the planet finished forming around 4.56 billion years ago, roughly 90 million years before our own planet. Further, evidence suggests that most of the Martian surface is old. So, why are chunks of Martian rock showing such a young age?\\n\\nMars landscape captured by the Pathfinder lander. Image source: NASA/JPL\\n\\nThe answer, they say, most likely lies in the constant bombardment of the Martian surface by meteorites and asteroids. With roughly 200 bombardments that create 4-meter craters each year, the Martian surface is constantly spewing more rock into space, some of which finds its way to Earth. The reason the Martian rock’s age doesn’t seem to add up is because the younger rock is replacing the older rock as it gets ejected from the planet.\\n\\nThis means that the younger rock from under the surface, which is still being replenished by volcanic activity, is eventually exposed to the surface and thus becomes the ejecta that meteorites send flying into space. This, a group of scientists explain in a paper published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, could help us understand why the Martian rocks found on Earth appear so young.\\n\\nUnderstanding how Mars is changing – both inside and out – is important as NASA and others prepare for the first manned missions to Mars. Further, scientists are constantly looking for new ways to understand how the planets within our solar system formed, and how that can teach us more about the universe’s evolution as a whole.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Apple started using OLED screens in the iPhone X back in 2017, and before that, in the first Apple Watch. And the Touch Bar, of course (RIP). But it’s been slow to move away from LCD elsewhere, like its iMacs, MacBooks, standalone displays, and iPads. I want OLED on all those things, but if the iPad Pro gets it first, as rumor has it, then that’s fine by me.\\n\\nThere’s no product where the use of an LCD panel bothers me more than my 11-inch iPad Pro. It’s got a nice-looking screen so long as I’m looking directly at it. Go a little off-axis, though, and the screen gets way dimmer. That’s true of my laptop, too, but I’m always sitting directly in front of that screen, and almost always looking at a browser window with text in it.\\n\\nContrast isn’t an LCD’s strong suit either, and the gray-black of the letterboxing and shadows when I’m watching movies and shows bothers me more than it probably should. That doesn’t matter if I’m just reading, but if I’m playing a game — especially something like Resident Evil Village, which I’m sure will run on the next iPad Pro — or watching a movie, the added deep blacks of OLED would look nicer. And in a dark horror game, it’d be easier to spot things with the extra contrast.\\n\\nOLED would mean other things, like an always-on iPad screen. That could open up a version of iPhone’s StandBy mode that turns the iPad into a true blue smart display (something that’s been rumored before), actually unlocking a niche for the iPad that it really could use.\\n\\nAssuming an OLED upgrade means more than just a nice screen for the next Pro model, I’d sell my M1 iPad Pro in a heartbeat to buy it.\\n\\nIt sounds like I might have my wish soon. This morning, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reiterated in the subscriber Q&A section of Power On something he’s said in the past: that Apple has a new OLED iPad Pro coming next year. And in that last update, he called it the “first major overhaul in half a decade,” in the form of an 11-inch model and a 13-inch one, and I hope that’s true because it needs it.',\n",

       "  'content': 'There’s nothing super about the opening weekend of Disney’s superhero adventure “The Marvels,” which whiffed at the box office with $63 million internationally and $110 million globally.\\n\\nThose figures are far behind expectations (heading into the weekend, Disney hoped for $140 million or more, and even that wouldn’t have been great for the $220 million-budgeted tentpole) and rank as one of the worst worldwide debuts in the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\n\\n“The Marvels” is the 33rd MCU film and the sequel to 2019’s billion-dollar behemoth, “Captain Marvel,” which debuted to a massive $302 million internationally and $455 million globally. That film, which introduced Brie Larson’s Carol Danvers, was fortuitously sandwiched between two of the biggest movies of all time, 2018’s “Avengers: Infinity War” and 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame.”\\n\\nBut there are other reasons behind the brutal drop in ticket sales. “Captain Marvel” came at a time when the MCU — an unrivaled franchise that has delivered $30 billion globally across 15 years — could do no wrong at the box office. In the time since, Disney has inundated viewers with countless spinoffs, sequels and TV series on the big and small screen. “The Marvels” demonstrates that Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are mortals, after all.\\n\\n“The notion of having connected universes and characters traveling between the big and small screen has created some disinterest by audiences,” says senior Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian.\\n\\nThough none of the overseas territories were standout, China landed the biggest start outside of the U.S. with a soft $11.7 million, followed by the U.K. with $4.3 million, Indonesia with $3.7 million, Korea with $3.5 million and France with $3.1 million. “The Marvels” also failed to resonate in Imax as the premium format contributed just $5.6 million internationally and $10 million worldwide.\\n\\nNia DaCosta (“Candyman”) directed “The Marvels,” which again spotlights Larson as Captain Marvel, and elevates the profile of Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau and Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel. Like the 32 movies before it, the trio of heroes are tasked with saving the universe from forces that seek to destroy it. “The Marvels” has not been embraced by critics (it holds a 63% on Rotten Tomatoes), though reviewers have praised the breezy runtime (it’s the shortest MCU movie to date) and Vellani’s turn as Ms. Marvel.\\n\\nWith future movies, Disney’s CEO Bob Iger has recently promised a return to quality over quantity. The studio has time to reassess because, for now, “Deadpool 3” is the only MCU film on the calendar for 2024.\\n\\n“After decades of unwavering fan loyalty, the superhero genre seems to be at a crossroads and a reassessment of what will drive audiences to the multiplex is in order,” Paul Dergarabedian adds. “Marvel [is a] massive brand that remains appealing to audiences around the world, but new strategies may have to be instituted to ensure future success.”',\n",

       "  'content': 'The detection of ammonia isotopologues in a brown dwarf by the James Webb Space Telescope offers groundbreaking insights into the formation of gas giants and exoplanets, revealing potential alternative formation processes.\\n\\nThey reveal the origin of wine, the age of bones and fossils, and they serve as diagnostic tools in medicine. Isotopes and isotopologues – molecules that differ only in the composition of their isotopes – also play an increasingly important role in astronomy. For example, the ratio of carbon-12 (12C) to carbon-13 (13C) isotopes in the atmosphere of an exoplanet allows scientists to infer the distance at which the exoplanet orbits its central star.\\n\\nAdvancements in Isotopologue Detection\\n\\nUntil now, 12C and 13C bound in carbon monoxide were the only isotopologues that could be measured in the atmosphere of an exoplanet. Now a team of researchers has succeeded in detecting ammonia isotopologues in the atmosphere of a cold brown dwarf. As the team has just reported in the journal Nature, ammonia could be measured in the form of 14NH3 and 15NH3. Astrophysicists Polychronis Patapis and Adrian Glauser, who are members of the Department of Physics as well as of the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) PlanetS, were involved in the study – Patapis as one of the first authors.\\n\\nExploring Brown Dwarfs\\n\\nBrown dwarfs are somewhere in between stars and planets: they resemble giant gas planets in many ways, which is why they can be used as a model system to study gas giants. In their work, Patapis and colleagues observed a brown dwarf, called WISE J1828, that’s 32.5 light years away from Earth; in the night sky, it is located in the constellation Lyra, the lyre.\\n\\nWISE J1828 cannot be seen with the naked eye: with an effective temperature (that is, the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same amount of energy as the observed object) of only 100°C, it is far too cold for hydrogen fusion to take place and send light all the way to Earth. To spot this ultracold dwarf star of the Y spectral class, the mirrors of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) were turned in the direction of the lyre last summer.\\n\\nThe Role of the JWST\\n\\nThe Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI), an infrared detector installed on board the JWST, made it possible to reveal the ammonia isotopologues on WISE J1828. In the wavelength range between 4.9 and 27.9 μm, the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) of MIRI recorded a spectrum of the brown dwarf where, in addition to ammonia, the researchers observed water and methane molecules, each with characteristic absorption bands. In particular, ammonia causes an attenuation of the signal arriving at the detector in the wavelength range between 9 and 13 μm.\\n\\nThe isotopologues of ammonia can also be resolved spectroscopically: if ammonia molecules don’t consist of the most common nitrogen isotope 14N, which is bound to three hydrogen atoms, but of 15N plus three hydrogen atoms, the additional neutron in the nitrogen nucleus ensures that there is a kink in the spectrum that can be explained by the presence of 15NH3.\\n\\nNew Tools for Studying Exoplanets\\n\\nThe ratio of the two isotopologues of ammonia measured in the atmosphere of WISE J1828 is especially exciting: as Patapis and colleagues explain, the 14NH3-to-15NH3 ratio is a tracer, that is, an indicator that can be used in the future to study star and planet formation. It’s a new tool that will help to test different, known formation mechanisms for gas giants.\\n\\nGas giants such as Jupiter or Saturn are not special to our Solar System. These bodies play an important role in the study of exoplanets: they appear early during the formation of stars and are thus a crucial factor determining whether and how smaller, lighter planets develop. Until now, there has been no definitive answer to the question of how massive gas giants form. Experts have developed different theories, but it’s unclear whether these planets form by nuclear accretion – like most other planets – or as a result of gravitational collapse in the protoplanetary disk around the progenitor star.\\n\\nInsights Into Planet Formation\\n\\nThe isotopologue ratio recorded by Patapis and coworkers can provide new clues. On Earth, there are 272 14N atoms for every 15N atom. The paper reports that the 14NH3-to-15NH3 ratio measured in the atmosphere of WISE J1828 is 670, which means that the brown dwarf has accumulated less nitrogen-15 in the course of its formation compared to that of Earth and other planets such as Jupiter. In fact, the abundance of 15N is scarcer on WISE J1828 than it is on all celestial bodies in our Solar System.\\n\\nThe processes of so-called isotope fractionation, that is, the change in isotope abundance, aren’t fully understood, but comet impacts are thought to contribute to an enrichment of nitrogen-15 because comets have a significantly higher 15N content. Comet impacts are also believed to be a fundamental planetary building block in the Solar System: comets contributed to the formation of Earth’s atmosphere, even though it isn’t entirely clear to what extent.\\n\\nA low 15NH3 content in the spectrum of WISE J1828 suggests that the brown dwarf didn’t follow the usual way of planet formation – namely, nuclear accretion – but formed star-like instead, a scenario that points to gravitational collapse. This type of gravitational instability is thus likely to play an important role in the formation of gas giants, especially those that move around their star on large orbits.\\n\\nIndeed, this is another significant point discussed in the paper: the 14NH3-to-15NH3 ratio appears to vary greatly depending on the distance between a gas giant and its star, as shown by simulations of a forming planet between the ammonia and molecular nitrogen ice lines. In astronomy, ice lines indicate the minimum distances from the central star at which the temperature is low enough for a particular volatile chemical compound to change to a solid form.\\n\\nAccording to Patapis and colleagues, the observation of an increased 14NH3-to-15NH3 ratio could indicate planetary accretion of ices between the ammonia and nitrogen ice lines.\\n\\nImplications and Future Research\\n\\nAstronomers have just gained an additional tool to study directly observable exoplanets. The ammonia trail only became tangible thanks to the JWST, confirming once again the enormous value and unparalleled performance of this space telescope.\\n\\nReference: “15NH3 in the atmosphere of a cool brown dwarf” by David Barrado, Paul Mollière, Polychronis Patapis, Michiel Min, Pascal Tremblin, Francisco Ardevol Martinez, Niall Whiteford, Malavika Vasist, Ioannis Argyriou, Matthias Samland, Pierre-Olivier Lagage, Leen Decin, Rens Waters, Thomas Henning, María Morales-Calderón, Manuel Guedel, Bart Vandenbussche, Olivier Absil, Pierre Baudoz, Anthony Boccaletti, Jeroen Bouwman, Christophe Cossou, Alain Coulais, Nicolas Crouzet, René Gastaud, Alistair Glasse, Adrian M.

       "  'content': 'I love the Pixel 8 Pro, but there’s one element of the phone I just haven’t been using, and that’s the temperature sensor.\\n\\nThis issue of 9to5Google Weekender is a part of 9to5Google’s rebooted newsletter that highlights the biggest Google stories with added commentary and other tidbits. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox early!\\n\\nPixel phones have largely focused on providing a simple, smart experience, but Google also hasn’t been shy in trying out some random gimmicks here or there. The Pixel 4 is the biggest example of this, with the device debuting a Soli radar sensor that, while neat, wasn’t super useful and ultimately didn’t make it to any further releases. Ever since that, it’s felt like Google has played it especially safe, but the Pixel 8 Pro does, well, not that.\\n\\nIn a bizarre choice, Google equipped the Pixel 8 Pro with a temperature sensor on the back. The sensor can detect the surface temperature of an object when you’re within a few inches, but that’s really all it does. Google is waiting on FDA approval to capture human body temperatures using the sensor, which could maybe be a little useful, but as it stands today there’s just an app that can detect the surface temperature of an object.\\n\\nAnd, folks, I can’t express how useless this has been so far.\\n\\nIn the several weeks I’ve been using the Pixel 8 Pro I’ve used this sensor all of twice, both just to get a sense of how it worked for our review. And, while the sensor works and the app is easy enough to use, there has not been a single valid use case that I’ve thought of. Every once in a while I’m just reminded that the sensor even exists because most of the time it’s far from mind.\\n\\nNot even Google could come up with a genuinely useful use case for this feature, which is why it’s something that’s just buried. It only shows up in one app, is never mentioned in marketing, and literally only has one mention on Google’s own store page for the phone.\\n\\nAnd, as a result, I just keep forgetting that it’s even there. Case in point, earlier this week Nick Sutrich over at Android Central put the Pixel 8 Pro’s temperature sensor through the wringer in a series of tests up against a classic thermometer and the results were not especially impressive. The Pixel was generally off by a decent margin in every test, which really just reinforces that it is not a useful feature. But, when I saw that post, I legitimately said to myself “oh right that’s a thing.”\\n\\nI’m not convinced even approval for human body temperatures will make this sensor useful, and I feel quite confident that this won’t make it to the Pixel’s next generation.\\n\\nThis Week’s Top Stories\\n\\nAmazon might be ditching Android\\n\\nA new report this week revealed that Amazon, which has been using a “forked” version of Android for many of its products for several years now, is working on an in-house OS that would lead to it eventually ditching Android in many, if not all of its products. Apparently, this would start with Fire TV.\\n\\nGoogle removes Fitbit from a ton of markets\\n\\nNothing Google does should be surprising at this point, but it was revealed this week that the company has removed Fitbit products from over half of the markets it was active in, and it’s a decision that’s still got us scratching our heads. With one of the chief complaints of Pixel being its limited footprint, Fitbit’s wider reach seemed like a natural stepping stone to wider Pixel availability, and now it’s just gone.\\n\\nIt’s a weird choice.\\n\\nMore Top Stories\\n\\nFrom the rest of 9to5\\n\\n9to5Mac: This iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma feature makes AutoFill even more convenient\\n\\n9to5Toys: NZXT H6 Flow review: The just-right size compact dual-chamber computer case [Video]\\n\\nElectrek: Tesla Cybertruck specs leak every dimension + 14-50 outlet in bed\\n\\nConnectTheWatts: MyFitnessPal introduces new sleep feature',\n",

There is a misprint on the I/O cover, where “Evangenlion” is erroneously spelled. Unlike the LED illuminated part adjacent to it, this particular component cannot be easily replaced, leaving users with limited options for addressing this matter, such as resorting to using a black marker.\\n\\nThe EVA-02 series includes a range of PC components, including motherboards, graphics cards, power supplies, and even a case. Users also have access to peripherals such as keyboards or headsets. A quick check reveals that only the motherboard is affected by this particular issue.\\n\\nOnce assembled, the complete EVA-02 system will not display this error, owing to the fact that this component will be covered by a fan.\\n\\nOfficial EVA-02 system, Source: ASUS\\n\\nThis error has unfortunately persisted across models that already shipped, and it is still present in official promotional materials. The oversight went unnoticed for a while, but the early unboxing videos from September have already exposed this problem clearly. Adding to the issue, this high-end motherboard features the correct spelling of “Evangelion” multiple times, with only one instance containing the typo.\\n\\nWe are curious if ASUS intends to address and replace the misprinted components. One can hope that ASUS will exhibit greater attention to detail in future iterations of their products. On a positive note, the RTX 4090 EVA-02 remains unaffected by this issue. This is especially important because the graphics card costs between $2300 and $3000, depending on the source, while the motherboard costs about $700.\\n\\nSource: @halrafel, HKEPC, @momomo_us',\n",

One thing that we can say about few of these changes is that Apple could be seriously worried about what it plans to offer to iPhone users with the new version.\\n\\nAccording to reports and details given by 9to5Mac, Apple could be about to relent to the pressure of the European Union and allow other app stores to run on iPhones via sideloading of apps.\\n\\nIf anyone has followed the tussle between Apple and the EU regulators, the former is being pushed to comply with the new Digital Markets Act (DMA) which orders a slew of changes to provide fair competition to all tech companies.\\n\\nApple has been strictly against the prospect of letting iPhone users sideload apps but the new code lines of the iOS 17.2 beta version, as observed in the report, suggest these policies are going to change, which is going to be a big security nightmare for the company.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\\'s credibility:\\n\\nThe earth’s internal layers. NASA. Credit: Goddard Media Studios\\n\\nScientists have dated the birth of the solar system to about 4.57 billion years ago. About 60 million years later a \"giant impact\" collision between the infant Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia created the moon.\\n\\nNow, new research suggests that the remains of the large object that collided with the young Earth to form the moon are still identifiable deep within the planet as two large lumps. These lumps make up about 8% of the volume of the Earth\\'s mantle, which is the rocky zone between the Earth\\'s iron core and its crust.\\n\\nThe new study, led by Qian Yuan of Arizona State University and Caltech, argues that the heat generated by this collision was not enough to melt the whole of the Earth\\'s mantle, so the innermost mantle remained solid.\\n\\nConsequently, the researchers say, the melted mantle of Theia didn\\'t completely mix with Earth\\'s mantle. That would have made the Theia remnants indistinguishable from Earth\\'s mantle as a whole. Instead, a lot of Theia\\'s mantle ended up as two continent-sized lumps that now sit on top of the Earth\\'s core-mantle boundary.\\n\\nLarge low-velocity provinces\\n\\nYuan argues that these lumps correspond to, and can explain, the existence of the two large low-velocity provinces (LLVPs), that were discovered decades ago: one below the Pacific and another below Africa and the eastern Atlantic. A high resolution computer simulation of Theia colliding with the earth to form the moon. Credit: NASA\\n\\nThis discovery was thanks to the observation that the vibrations emanating from earthquakes, known as seismic waves, travel through these regions slightly more slowly than through \"normal\" lower mantle.\\n\\nPrevious explanations of the LLVPs include that each is a deep accumulation of subducted oceanic plates (where plate tectonics has dragged the ocean floor down beneath a continent). Or that they are a place where anomalously hot lower mantle is beginning to rise as a \"superplume\" (huge jets of partially molten rock).\\n\\nHowever, neither of those models can account for a peculiar enrichment in volatile elements such as helium and xenon in lava that has erupted at oceanic islands above LLVPs. Yuan argues these are \"fingerprints\" of Theia\\'s growth within the gas and dust surrounding the young sun before it collided with Earth.\\n\\nMelting or not melting the whole mantle?\\n\\nComputer models run by Yuan\\'s team suggest that the giant impact that formed the moon would have not delivered enough energy to melt the whole of the Earth\\'s mantle. Instead, the melted remains of Theia\\'s mantle, which was slightly richer in iron (making it denser than Earth\\'s mantle) ended up at the base of the temporary magma ocean created by the collision.\\n\\nLater, after the magma ocean had solidified, the Theia material was drawn into the lower part of Earth\\'s mantle by convection currents, which flow at rates of centimeters per year even within the solid mantle. Caltech’s Qian Yuan explains by means of computer simulations.\\n\\nIt may have taken billions of years for these convection currents to heap up the Theia material into the LLVPs that we see today. Even if this is true, they should not be thought of as vast chunks of Theia\\'s mantle that survived the impact. Rather, they are made of initially dispersed Theia mantle material that has been gathered up again.\\n\\nIs it true?\\n\\nMost scientists will take a lot of convincing when it comes to this theory. Yuan predicts that if his hypothesis is correct, samples of the moon\\'s mantle, collected by future missions, will match the geochemical fingerprints found in volcanic rock from the LLVPs. I think that that proof will be a long time coming.\\n\\nI also note that Yuan\\'s modeling seems to be silent on the fate of Theia\\'s core. Scientists usually assume Theia\\'s core merged with Earth\\'s core in the hours after the collision.\\n\\nIt is not clear how that could have happened if the lower part of Earth\\'s mantle remained solid. On the other hand, Theia\\'s impact happened so soon after the Earth itself was formed (probably by a series of separate collisions) that the Earth\\'s interior could still have been hot and molten in the aftermath of those events.\\n\\nThe implications of Yuan\\'s model are worth thinking about. For one thing, would the slow heaping up of Theia mantle material into the LLVPs have had any effect of on the pattern of plate tectonics high above? Possibly we would not have had an Atlantic ocean today had Theia not slammed into the proto-Earth four and a half billion years ago.\\n\\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Instead, users can access these chats by entering the secret code into the search bar within the Chats tab,” the report noted.\\n\\nWith this feature, the report mentioned that users gain enhanced privacy by removing the entry point to the locked chats list, others won’t be able to easily identify or access the conversations that are locked. This will ensure that others can’t easily identify or access these secured conversations, effectively preventing accidental or unauthorised entry into sensitive discussions.\\n\\nWith the locked chats list hidden, even if someone gains physical access to a user’s phone, they won’t be able to see your sensitive conversations.\\n\\nIn addition, hiding the list of locked conversations helps prevent exposure because anyone can understand that there may be some locked conversations, according to the report. Meanwhile, WhatsApp has added a new ‘Protect IP Address in Calls’ option that helps hide your location from other parties on the call.\\n\\nThe new option hides your IP address from the other party by relaying calls through WhatsApp Servers, ensuring that other parties in the call cannot see your IP and subsequently deduce your general geographical location.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Data from NASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft and Pioneer Venus Orbiter is used in an undated composite image of the planet Venus. (Reuters)\\n\\nEstimated read time: 3-4 minutes\\n\\nWASHINGTON — Oxygen accounts for about 21% of Earth\\'s air, with the rest of our atmosphere primarily nitrogen. And most living things — including people, as we well know — need oxygen to survive.\\n\\nEarth\\'s planetary neighbor Venus offers quite a different story. Its thick and noxious atmosphere is dominated by carbon dioxide — 96.5% — with lesser amounts of nitrogen and trace gases. Oxygen is nearly absent. In fact, with Venus getting far less scientific attention than other planets such as Mars, the direct detection of its oxygen has remained difficult.\\n\\nUsing an instrument aboard the SOFIA airborne observatory — a Boeing 747SP aircraft modified to carry an infrared telescope in a joint project between NASA and the German Aerospace Center — scientists have now detected atomic oxygen in a thin layer sandwiched between two other layers of the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\nThey noted that this atomic oxygen, which consists of a single oxygen atom, differs from molecular oxygen, which consists of two oxygen atoms and is breathable.\\n\\nThe researchers directly detected oxygen for the first time on the side of Venus facing the sun — where it actually is produced in the atmosphere — as well as detecting it on the side facing away from the sun, where it previously was spotted by a ground-based telescope in Hawaii. Venus rotates much more slowly than Earth.\\n\\n\"The Venus atmosphere is very dense. The composition is also very different from Earth,\" said German Aerospace Center physicist Heinz-Wilhelm Hübers, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications.\\n\\nThe thick atmosphere on the second planet from the sun traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect.\\n\\n\"Venus is not hospitable, at least for organisms we know from Earth,\" Hübers added.\\n\\nThe oxygen is produced on the planet\\'s dayside by ultraviolet radiation from the sun that breaks down atmospheric carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide into oxygen atoms and other chemicals, the researchers said. Some of the oxygen is then transported by winds to the Venusian night side.\\n\\n\"This detection of atomic oxygen on Venus is direct proof for the action of photochemistry — triggered by solar UV radiation — and for the transport of its products by the winds of Venus\\' atmosphere,\" said astrophysicist and study co-author Helmut Wiesemeyer of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany.\\n\\n\"On Earth, our life-protecting stratospheric ozone layer represents a well-known example of such photochemistry,\" Wiesemeyer added.\\n\\nOn Venus, there is a layer of clouds containing sulfuric acid up to a height of about 40 miles above the planetary surface, with hurricane-force winds blowing in the opposite direction of the planet\\'s rotation. About 75 miles above the surface, strong winds blow in the same direction as the planet\\'s rotation.\\n\\nThe oxygen was found to be concentrated between those two ferocious layers, at an altitude about 60 miles. The oxygen\\'s temperature was found to range from about minus 184 degrees Fahrenheit on the planet\\'s day side to minus 256 degrees Fahrenheit on its night side.\\n\\nMethods used previously to detect Venusian oxygen on the day side were indirect, based on measurements of other molecules in combination with photochemical models.\\n\\nVenus, with a diameter of about 7,500 miles, is slightly smaller than Earth. In our solar system, Earth resides comfortably within the \"habitable zone\" around the sun — the distance considered not too close and not too far from a star to be able to host life, with Venus near the inner boundary and Mars close to the outer edge.\\n\\n\"We are still at the beginning of understanding the evolution of Venus and why it is so different from Earth,\" Hübers said.\\n\\n×\\n\\nPhotos\\n\\nMost recent Science stories\\n\\nRelated topics Science',\n",

       "  'content': 'The very best single-player video games offer multiple points that stick with players; moments that people will want to revisit for years or even decades after. Unfortunately, it\\'s not always easy to do that, as games usually require that a player spend hours getting back to that point if they want to replay one specific moment. Clearly, PlayStation has been thinking about that, and how the company can extend the replay value of its single-player games. A new patent filed by the company titled \"Content Streaming With Gameplay Launch\" would incorporate \"trigger points\" that can be launched by the player to revisit specific moments and cut scenes.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear exactly how this would work in practice, but Sony\\'s patent states that \"each trigger point may be associated with a set of game data specific to a gameplay scene within an interactive title.\" Once that trigger point has been unlocked by the player, \"gameplay may be launched by the user device based on the identified set of game data associated with the selected trigger point.\" Basically, it sounds like the game would be broken down into chapters like on a DVD or Blu-Ray, and unlocked trigger points could be revisited after the fact.\\n\\n(Photo: PlayStation, U.S. Patent Office)\\n\\nHow Trigger Points Could Work\\n\\nWhile this patent offers a compelling look at what could be added to future PlayStation games, it\\'s unclear whether the option would also be added to existing ones. It\\'s possible we could see this added to games like Marvel\\'s Wolverine, but it\\'s hard to say whether PlayStation would go back and add the feature to titles like Marvel\\'s Spider-Man 2. Presumably, this would be exclusive to Sony\\'s first-party games, but it\\'s possible we could see it implemented in third-party games like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth. At this time, there\\'s simply no way of knowing for sure!\\n\\nPlayStation Patents\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that, just because Sony has patented this potential feature, it does not necessarily mean that we\\'ll see it incorporated into future games. The company has filed a lot of patents over the years that failed to reach audiences, including an option that would have allowed everyday items to be used in place of a PS5 controller. The example in that patent cited bananas being used in multiplayer games, which is obviously something that still hasn\\'t been seen!\\n\\nThe reality is, companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo are constantly looking at new ways of improving the experience for users. Sometimes these concepts make it to market, while many others do not. For now, PlayStation fans will just have to wait patiently to see if these trigger points are ever actually added to PlayStation\\'s games!\\n\\nWould you like to be able to revisit certain points in a single-player game?

Right now, we have this rare chance that nature has given us to get a detailed view of individual stars that are located very far away. While we are currently only able to see the brightest ones, if we do this long enough—and frequently enough—we will be able to determine how many bright stars there are, and how massive they are.\"\\n\\nUsing the advanced technological capabilities of the JWST, Yan and his team, including Mizzou graduate student Bangzheng Sun, confirmed what\\'s causing the galaxy cluster\\'s \"flickering lights\" or transients that scientists first saw years ago using NASA\\'s Hubble Space Telescope.\\n\\n\"We\\'re calling MACS0416 the Christmas Tree Galaxy Cluster, both because it\\'s so colorful and because of the flickering lights we find within it,\" Yan said. \"We can see so many transients in certain regions of this area because of a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing, which is magnifying galaxies behind this cluster.\"\\n\\nThe team discovered the transients by studying four sets of images taken by JWST of the galaxy cluster over a period of 126 days, or about four months. Yan is particularly excited that two of the transients are supernovae—stars that are at the end of their lifespans—because the team can use them to study the supernovae\\'s host galaxies.\\n\\n\"The two supernovae and the other twelve extremely magnified stars are of different nature, but they are all important,\" Yan said. \"We have traced the change in brightness over time through their light curves, and by examining in detail how the light changes over time, we\\'ll eventually be able to know what kind of stars they are. More importantly, we\\'ll be able to understand the detailed structure of the magnifying glass and how it relates to dark matter distribution. This is a completely new view of the universe that\\'s been opened by JWST.\"\\n\\n\"JWST\\'s PEARLS: Transients in the MACS J0416.1-2403 Field\" has recently been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal.

       "  'content': 'Astronomers have spotted the eroding remains of 100 dwarf galaxies that have been violently stripped of their outer layer of stars by larger galaxies. These disrupted galaxies represent the \"missing link\" in the evolution of a puzzling type of galaxy called ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs).\\n\\nThe discovery shows that UCDs — which are among the densest collections of stars in the universe — are the fossilized remains of normal dwarf galaxies that have been destroyed in violent gravitational encounters with other galaxies.\\n\\n\\n\\nAstronomers first discovered UCDs more than two decades ago. The ultra-dense galaxies posed a mystery for astronomers because they are smaller and more compact than ordinary dwarf galaxies but larger than the star clusters they most closely resemble. Scientists theorized that UCDs were the remains of destroyed dwarf galaxies, but they lacked an intermediate galaxy to help confirm the transition.\\n\\nSo astronomers at the Gemini North telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawai\\'i began searching for these cosmic missing links around the Virgo Cluster — a group of around 2,000 galaxies located around 65 million light-years from Earth. The telescope spotted dozens of dwarf galaxies that seem to be undergoing this transformation.\\n\\n\"Our results provide the most complete picture of the origin of this mysterious class of galaxy that was discovered nearly 25 years ago,\" Eric Peng , a NOIRLab astronomer at the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University, said in a statement. \"Here we show that 106 small galaxies in the Virgo cluster have sizes between normal dwarf galaxies and UCDs, revealing a continuum that fills the \\'size gap\\' between star clusters and galaxies.\"\\n\\nRelated: Astronomers just caught the tiniest cannibal galaxy in the universe\\n\\nPeng is a co-author of a paper detailing the discovery of these missing link galaxies published Wednesday, Nov. 8, in the journal Nature .\\n\\nThe recently identified galaxies seem to be in the early stages of UCD formation. All are located close to massive galaxies. This suggests that the gravitational influence of the nearby massive galaxies has stripped these smaller cosmic objects of their stars and gas.\\n\\nThe astronomers also saw objects within the Virgo Cluster with stretched and diffuse envelopes of gas and stars, as if they are currently being dragged away. Other objects seem to show different phases of this UCDtransition.\\n\\nAn image of NGC 3628 or the \"Hamburger Galaxy\" captured by Víctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope with its tidal tail of stars containing the ultra-compact dwarf galaxy NGC 3628-UCD1. (Image credit: CTIO/NOIRLab/DOE/NSF/AURA)\\n\\n\"Once we analyzed the Gemini observations and eliminated all the background contamination, we could see that these transition galaxies existed almost exclusively near the largest galaxies,\" lead author Laixiang Wang , a scientist at Peking University, said in the statement. \"We immediately knew that environmental transformation had to be important.\"\\n\\nWhen arranged into a time sequence, the team got a picture of what appears to be the story of these star-robbed galaxies. \"It\\'s exciting that we can finally see this transformation in action,\" Peng concluded.\"It tells us that many of these UCDs are visible fossil remnants of ancient dwarf galaxies in galaxy clusters, and our results suggest that there are likely many more low-mass remnants to be found.\"',\n",

       "  'content': 'New research offers a theory on how gold, platinum, and other precious metals found their way to shallow pockets within Earth’s mantle.\\n\\nScientists at Yale and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) say they’ve hit the jackpot with some valuable new information about the story of gold.\\n\\nIt’s a story that begins with violent collisions of large objects in space, continues in a half-melted region of Earth’s mantle, and ends with precious metals finding an unlikely resting spot much closer to the planet’s surface than scientists would have predicted.\\n\\nNew Insights on Precious Metals\\n\\nJun Korenaga, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Simone Marchi, a researcher at SwRI in Boulder, Colorado, provide details in a study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\n\\nTheir new theory provides possible answers to lingering questions about the way gold, platinum, and other precious metals found their way to shallow pockets within Earth’s mantle rather than deep in the planet’s core. More broadly, the new theory offers insights into planet formation throughout the universe.\\n\\n“Our research is a good example of making an unexpected discovery after re-examining conventional wisdom,” Korenaga said.\\n\\nHistorical Context and Challenges\\n\\nRecent research from scientists around the world has established that precious metals such as gold and platinum came to Earth billions of years ago after the early proto-Earth collided with large, moon-sized bodies in space, which left behind deposits of materials that were folded into what is today’s Earth.\\n\\nBut that absorption process has remained something of a mystery.\\n\\nAside from being valued for their scarcity, aesthetic beauty, and use in high-tech products, gold and platinum are what is known as highly “siderophile” elements. They are drawn to the element iron to such a degree that they would be expected to collect almost entirely in Earth’s metallic core — either by merging directly with the metal core on impact or by sinking quickly from the mantle into the core.\\n\\nBy this logic, they should not have collected at or near the Earth’s surface. Yet they did.\\n\\nA Groundbreaking Theory\\n\\n“Working with Simone, who is an expert on impact dynamics, I was able to come up with a novel solution to this conundrum,” Korenaga said.\\n\\nKorenaga and Marchi’s theory centers around a thin, “transient” region of the mantle, where the shallow part of the mantle melts and the deeper part remains solid. The researchers found that this region has peculiar dynamic properties that can efficiently trap falling metallic components and slowly deliver them to the rest of the mantle.\\n\\nTheir theory posits that this delivery is still ongoing, with the remnants of the transient region appearing as “large low-shear-velocity provinces” — well-known geophysical anomalies in the deep mantle.\\n\\n“This transient region almost always forms when a big impactor hits the early Earth, making our theory quite robust,” Marchi said.\\n\\nThe researchers said the new theory not only explains previously enigmatic aspects of Earth’s geochemical and geophysical evolution, but it also highlights the wide range of time scales involved in Earth’s formation.\\n\\n“One of the remarkable things we found was that the dynamics of the transient mantle region take place in a very short amount of time — about a day — yet its influence on subsequent Earth evolution has lasted a few billion years,” Korenaga said.\\n\\nFor more on this research, see Are Moon-Sized Impacts the Secret Behind Gold & Platinum in Earth’s Mantle?\\n\\nReference: “Vestiges of impact-driven three-phase mixing in the chemistry and structure of Earth’s mantle” by Jun Korenaga and Simone Marchi, 9 October 2023, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.2309181120\\n\\nFunding for the research came from NASA and the National Science Foundation.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Scientists are turning to artificial intelligence to quickly spot giant icebergs in satellite images with the goal of monitoring their shrinkage over time. And unlike the conventional iceberg-tracking approach, which takes a human a few minutes to outline just one of these structures in an image, AI accomplished the same task in less than 0.01 seconds. That\\'s 10,000 times faster.\\n\\n\"It is crucial to locate icebergs and monitor their extent, to quantify how much meltwater they release into the ocean,\" Anne Braakmann-Folgmann, lead author of a study on the results and a scientist at the University of Leeds in the U.K., said in a statement .\\n\\nIn late October, the British Antarctic Survey reported that massive ice sheets covering Antarctica will melt at an accelerated rate for the rest of the century, and contribute inevitably to sea level rise around the globe in the coming decades. Last year, one of the biggest icebergs known to scientists — A68a was more than 100 miles long and 30 miles wide — thawed in the South Atlantic Ocean after drifting for five years from its home in the Antarctic Peninsula, where it had broken apart in 2017.\\n\\nRelated:\\n\\nAlong with dumping 1 trillion tons of fresh water into the ocean, the melting iceberg also pumped nutrients into its environment, which will radically alter the local ecosystem for years to come, scientists have said. It\\'s still unclear whether this change will have a positive or negative effect on the marine food chain.\\n\\nScientists monitored A68a\\'s travels and shrinkage using images from satellites . Accurately identifying the iceberg, crucial to monitor changes to its size and shape over the years, is not an easy task, as the icebergs, sea ice and clouds are all white. Plus, although analyzing one satellite image for icebergs takes only a few minutes to complete, the time quickly adds up when thousands of images are waiting for their turn.\\n\\n\"In addition, the Antarctic coastline may resemble icebergs in the satellite images, so standard segmentation algorithms often select the coast too instead of just the actual iceberg,\" said Braakmann-Folgmann.\\n\\nSo to reduce this time-consuming and laborious process, researchers have, for the first time, trained a neural network to do the job.\\n\\nThe study team trained the AI to spot large icebergs by using images from the European Space Agency \\'s Sentinel-1 satellite, whose radar eyes can capture Earth \\'s surface regardless of cloud cover or lack of light.\\n\\nExcept for missing a few parts of icebergs bigger than the examples the AI was trained on — a solvable problem — scientists found the system managed to detect satellite image icebergs with 99 percent accuracy. This included correctly identifying seven icebergs ranging in size from 54 square kilometers (approximately the size of the city of Bern in Switzerland( to 1052 square kilometers (as large as Hong Kong.)\\n\\nScientists have used AI to measure the size of large icebergs. (Image credit: University of Leeds)\\n\\n\"This study shows that machine learning will enable scientists to monitor remote and inaccessible parts of the world in almost real-time,\" study co-author Andrew Shepherd, who is a professor at the Northumbria University in England, said in the statement.\\n\\nThe AI tool also didn\\'t make the same mistakes as other more conventional automated approaches, such as the error of misconstruing individual bits of ice as one collective iceberg, the researchers say.\\n\\n\"Being able to map iceberg extent automatically with enhanced speed and accuracy will enable us to observe changes in iceberg area for several giant icebergs more easily and paves the way for an operational application,\" said Braakmann-Folgmann.',\n",
